Node.js is a single-threaded application, but it can support concurrency via the concept of event and callbacks. Every Node.js API is asynchronous and being single-threaded, they use async function calls to maintain concurrency. Node uses observer patterns. Node thread keeps an event loop and whenever a task gets completed, it fires the corresponding event which signals the event-listener function to execute.
